                    <p>HelpMeChoose is a collaboration between six undergraduate students at the School of Interactive Arts & Technology at Simon Fraser University (SFU): Sofia Bautista, Nicole Lo, Nika Lohrasbi, Mandy Ng, Ji Seon Oh, and Moran Zhu.</p><p>The idea for the app came about following a chance meeting during one of our mutual classes, Advanced Human Computer Interaction. There we shared our university journeys and discovered that we each had either transferred from other SFU programs (Computing Science) or are currently completing joint degrees (with Business Administration, Communications, and Publishing. </p><p>Realizing that our experiences could have been vastly improved by the existence of a tool that lets users explore different programs by showcasing prior students' course projects, we hit the whiteboard immediately.</p>

                    <h2 class="about-heading">Our Aims</h2>
                    <p>We will post course projects submitted by former students, giving you a clear idea of what exactly a course's work entails. We'll also publish information pertaining to various post secondary programs in BC, including admission requirements, estimated costs*, co-op and honours opportunities, and so on. </p>
                    <p>We understand that information about post secondary programs is vast and easy to find. Our goals are not to replace post secondary marketing and existing education planning tools offered by the government and other organizations. Rather we aim to offer prospective students a deeper, more personal look at the excellent work being produced by students in those programs. </p>
