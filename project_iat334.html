                                <p> We were tasked with conducting our own user research to conceptualize a new feature for Companion, a mobile safety application which allows family and friends to contact and know the location of the user in times of trouble during their journey. This was the first time I was exposed to formal user experience research techniques like holding my own interviews with beginner, intermediate, and expert users. Although I have conducted surveys before in an instructional design context, it was a learning experience for me to take the research I collected and design a feature from scratch for a mobile application, especially for iOS as an individual used to Android. </p>

                                <p> This project required user research through contextual interviews, developing medium-fidelity wireframes to construct a proposal involving three different features and creating high-fidelity mockups for the final deliverable. </p>

                            <section id="project-process" data-anchor="project-process">
                                <h4> PROJECT PROCESS, GOAL, AND RESULT </h4>

                                <p> The project process began ideation through user research and using the obtained human data to develop personas. Around those personas three possible feature designs were proposed. After consulting with our instructor and teaching assistant, as well as discussing amongst the group which design would be the most viable with room for further refinement, we decided to go with the third feature, which is a button calculating an escape route. The scope of the feature design was limited through focusing on the specific goals of our personas. </p>

                                <p> During the ideation refinement meeting, wireframes for the feature were taped onto a whiteboard to find any missing gaps between screens, as well as consider any potential opportunities for design. A pair critique was done while sketching and making notes around each wireframe. </p>

                                <p> Using the ideas from the meeting, the elements of the feature were finalized: </p>
                                
                                <ul> 
                                    <li>Map can be enlarged and minimized throughout trip by pinch gestures</li>
                                    <li>Escape route can be selected on the map</li>
                                    <li>Police stations are highlighted on the map as possible escape routes</li>
                                    <li>Step-by-step directions are displayed to user during their trip</li>
                                    <li> Alternatively, user can also view the full directions while still being able to access main UI </li>
                                </ul>
                                
                                <p> The final step was dividing the feature and elements into two and developing mockups for the navigation feature, which can be viewed below: </p>

                                <p> Through this project, the student was able to hone their skills in visual design by applying them to a user interface context. This course and especially the feature design project teaches students that a design is more satisfying and effective for both the user and the designer when you go through the many steps of research to understand the five Ws (who, what, where, why, in what way, by what means) in relation to how a user might interact with a piece of technology. For future projects in this course and in the program, be prepared to perform more user research, no matter the method, how long it takes, the difficulties you may face, as long as you gain a further understanding in the mentality of users. </p>
